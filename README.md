# Invasive Escherichia coli in neonates in Chatinkha nursery

Supplementary materials and code generating figures for a paper describing the genomics of invasive E. coli in neonates in Malawi

## Supplementary data

Supplementary data is in the data folder, and includes three files:

1) Overall blood culture numbers for QECH: "Supp_tab_4_culture.csv"
2) Individual patient information and genomic data: "Supp_tab_3_genomes.csv"
3) AMR genes, outputs from AMRfinder: "ecoli_invasive_amrfinder.txt"

## Figures and Supplementary figures

The Rmarkdown document ecoli_invasive_markdown.Rmd contains the code to generate all of the figures apart from Supplementary Figure 2. This is in the file Supplementary Figure 2. You will require R, Rstudio and to install several R packages to run this successfully.
